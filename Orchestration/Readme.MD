Orchestrating ML Pipeline with Prefect
Introduction
This repository contains code and instructions to orchestrate an ML pipeline using Prefect, an open-source workflow management system. The pipeline consists of several steps, including converting Jupyter Notebook to Python script, Prefect setup, server configuration, deployment, worker setup, and scheduling or running the pipeline.

Steps in Orchestration
Have IPython Notebook File:

Ensure that you have completed all the data science tasks and save the Jupyter Notebook file (e.g., data_science.ipynb).
Convert IPython Notebook to Python Script:

Use the provided script convert_to_python.py to convert the Jupyter Notebook file into a Python script. The script will create a main.py file with functions and a main function/flow based on the notebook's contents.
Install Prefect:

Install Prefect by running the following command:
Copy code
pip install prefect
Start Prefect Server:

Start the Prefect server by running the following command:
sql
Copy code
prefect server start
Configure Prefect Server:

Configure the Prefect server API URL using the following command:
arduino
Copy code
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL http://127.0.0.1:4200/api
Initialize Prefect Project:

Initialize the Prefect project by running the following command to create a prefect.yaml file:
csharp
Copy code
prefect project init
Prefect Deployment:

Deploy the orchestration script (main.py) using the following command:
css
Copy code
prefect deploy main.py:main_flow -n trips -p zoomcamp1
Start Prefect Worker:

Start the Prefect worker using the following command and specify the pool name:
sql
Copy code
prefect worker start --pool 'zoomcamp1'
Schedule/Run the Pipeline:

Schedule or run the pipeline using the following command:
css
Copy code
prefect run main-flow/trips
